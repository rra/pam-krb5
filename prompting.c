/*
 * Prompt for a password.
 *
 * This function handles prompting both for a password for regular
 * authentication and for passwords when changing one's password.  The default
 * prompt is simply "Password:" for the former.  For the latter, a string
 * describing the type of password is passed in as prefix.  In this case, the
 * prompts is:
 *
 *     <prefix> <banner> password:
 *
 * where <prefix> is the argument passed and <banner> is the value of
 * args->banner (defaulting to "Kerberos").
 *
 * If args->config->expose_account is set, we append the principal name (taken
 * from args->config->ctx->princ) before the colon, so the prompts are:
 *
 *     Password for <principal>:
 *     <prefix> <banner> password for <principal>:
 *
 * Normally this is not done because it exposes the realm and possibly any
 * username to principal mappings, plus may confuse some ssh clients if sshd
 * passes the prompt back to the client.
 *
 * The entered password is stored in password.  The memory is allocated by the
 * application and returned as part of the PAM conversation.  It must be freed
 * by the caller.
 *
 * Returns a PAM success or error code.

/*
 * This is the generic prompting function called by both the MIT Kerberos and
 * Heimdal prompting implementations.  The MIT function takes a name and the
 * Heimdal function doesn't, which is the only difference between the two.
 * Both are simple wrappers that call this function.
 *
 * There are a lot of structures and different layers of code at work here,
 * making this code quite confusing.  This function is a prompter function to
 * pass into the Kerberos library, in particular krb5_get_init_creds_password.
 * It is used by the Kerberos library to prompt for a password if need be, and
 * also to prompt for password changes if the password was expired.
 *
 * The purpose of this function is to serve as glue between the Kerberos
 * library and the application (by way of the PAM glue).  PAM expects us to
 * pass back to the conversation function an array of prompts and receive from
 * the application an array of responses to those prompts.  We pass the
 * application an array of struct pam_message pointers, and the application
 * passes us an array of struct pam_response pointers.
 *
 * Kerberos, meanwhile, passes us in an array of krb5_prompt structs.  This
 * struct contains the prompt, a flag saying whether to suppress echoing of
 * what the user types for that prompt, and a buffer into which to store the
 * response.
 *
 * Therefore, what we're doing here is copying the prompts from the
 * krb5_prompt structs into pam_message structs, calling the conversation
 * function, and then copying the responses back out of pam_response structs
 * into the krb5_prompt structs to return to the Kerberos library.
